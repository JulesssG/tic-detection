# tic-detection
This repository contains all the code, presentations and the report related to a semester project supervised by Benjamin BÃ©jar Haro. This project try to leverage activity recognition techniques based on dynamical system modelling to detect tics on video data. Tic detection could help all people suffering from Tourette disorder or other related pathologies to learn how to prevent the tics and this improve their quality of life. This project has been realised in collaboration with ![Joey Ka-Yee Essoe](https://jhucoach.org/about/essoe/) and ![Joseph McGuire](https://jhucoach.org/about/jfmcguire/) from Hopkins university.

This repository serves also as a ![renku](https://datascience.ch/renku/) template.
